## Getting Started

### Downloading the Dataset
You can download the dataset from the [Wild2000 Release Page](https://github.com/yourusername/Wild2000/releases). The dataset is available in a compressed `.zip` format for easy download.

### Usage
To use the dataset in your project, follow these steps:
1. **Extract the Dataset**: Unzip the downloaded file to a local directory.
2. **Load the Data**: Use your preferred programming language to load the images and annotations. For example, in Python, you can use the following code snippet:
     ```python
    import cv2
    import os

    dataset_path = "path/to/Wild2000"
    model_folder = os.path.join(dataset_path, "model_images")
    cloth_folder = os.path.join(dataset_path, "cloth_images")

    # Load an example model image and its corresponding cloth image
    model_path = os.path.join(model_folder, "model_0001.jpg")
    cloth_path = os.path.join(cloth_folder, "cloth_0001.jpg")

    model_image = cv2.imread(model_path)
    cloth_image = cv2.imread(cloth_path)

    cv2.imshow("Model Image", model_image)
    cv2.imshow("Cloth Image", cloth_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
